This endeavor would not have been possible without my research advisor Prof. Heng Ji and her priceless feedback and inspiration. She has been the perfect advisor, providing more support and guidance than I ever ask for. 

I also could not have undertaken this journey without my mentors Manling Li and Chi Han, who generously helped me with their extraordinary knowledge and experience. Cooperating with them has been one of the most rewarding experiences of mine.

I am also grateful to my family and friends, for their belief in me has helped me stay motivated throughout this process. I would also like to thank my Syrian hamster, Jeremy, for all of the entertainment and emotional support.
