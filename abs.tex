Framing is the act “to select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text” \cite{entman1993}. Framing has been widely used in journalism to influence public opinion. However, analysis of news framing has majorly relied on human expert efforts. Efforts have been put into developing automatic framing analysis via computational linguistic approaches. In this paper, we propose to conduct framing analyses with a Generative Adversarial Network under a contrastive learning framework. We evaluate our method on a large-scale, multi-agency news dataset with crowd-sourced political stances and factuality labels. Our code and dataset will be released to facilitate future research.
