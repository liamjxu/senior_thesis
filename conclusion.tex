\chapter{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose a novel large-scale, multi-agency news dataset with crowd-sourced political stances and factuality labels to facilitate framing analysis. To conduct framing analysis on this dataset, two methods are proposed. The first is via learning a ``switch'' in the embedding space to latently edit the word embeddings, and the second utilizes a generative contrastive learning framework. We further conduct empirical studies and analysis to compare the news article differences from both political stances sides. We create an interactive demo website to directly display our pipelines.
