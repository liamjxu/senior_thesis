\chapter{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose a novel large-scale, multi-agency news dataset with crowd-sourced political stances and factuality labels to facilitate framing analysis. We show through empirical study and baseline training that the dataset reveals the discrepancy in linguistic features of the different news agencies with different political stances. To conduct framing analyses on this dataset, two methods are proposed. The first is via learning a ``switch'' in the embedding space to latently edit the word embeddings, and the second utilizes a generative contrastive learning framework. An interactive website is further created to directly demonstrate our pipelines.
